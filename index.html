            <h3>E-Ink Technology</h3>

            <p id="john">E-ink, or electronic ink, is a display technology designed to replicate the appearance of
                traditional ink on paper. Unlike conventional displays, E-ink screens are reflective, relying on
                ambient light for visibility without emitting light themselves. Notably, these displays feature
                low power consumption, requiring energy only when the screen content changes. This
                characteristic contributes to their energy efficiency and extended battery life. E-ink
                technology provides high contrast and wide viewing angles, ensuring readability in various
                lighting conditions, including direct sunlight. The flexibility and lightweight nature of E-ink
                screens allow for innovative design possibilities, and some are even rollable or foldable. A
                distinctive feature known as the "memory effect" enables displayed images to remain visible even
                when power is off. Commonly found in e-book readers, electronic shelf labels, and signage,
                E-ink's paper-like readability makes it a preferred choice in applications where a low-power and
                easily readable display is essential.</p>
